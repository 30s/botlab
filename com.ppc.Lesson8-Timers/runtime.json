    # TRIGGER
    # Describe when this bot should trigger and execute. Add the trigger IDs together to combine triggers.
    # For example, to trigger off of both a Schedule (1) and a Device Measurement (8): 1 + 8 ==math==> "trigger": 9
    #
    # 1 = Schedule (based off a cron schedule inside this runtime.json file)
    # 2 = Switching modes (home / away / etc.)
    # 4 = Device alert
    # 8 = Device measurements or state change
    # 16 = Question answered by the user
    # 32 = New device file (like a video or picture)
    # 64 = Reserved for timers
    # 128 = Device configuration or metadata was updated
    # 256 = Data Stream Message received

    # DEVICE TYPES
    # For trigger types 4 (alerts), 8 (measurements), and 128 (configurations), we must specify which device types
    # we want to interact with and how. When bots are attached to users' accounts, they automatically connect with
    # every device in the user's account that match these criteria.
    #
    # Use this command in your terminal to discover device types:
    #   botengine --device_types
    #
    # Attributes:
    #   * "id" = device type ID to interact with
    #   * "minOccurrence" = (optional) the minimum number of occurrences of this device type required for this bot to perform
    #   * "trigger" = true to trigger off devices of this type
    #   * "read" = true to read measurements from devices of this type
    #   * "control" = true to send commands to devices of this type
    #   * "triggerParamName" = (optional) a single parameter name to listen to, which can help optimize execution performance
    #   * "triggerParamValues" = (optional) only trigger when the 'triggerParamName' is equal to this value
    #   * "reason" = Message to the end user about why they should let your bot access this device. You can specify multiple languages.
