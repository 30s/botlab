# BotEngine: Adding Thoughts to Things.

The BotEngine is a Python framework that enables developers to create new features and services on top of every Internet-connected data source or device. This is no longer the Internet of Things. This is Ambient Computing.


## Installation

To install the BotEngine framework on your local machine, copy and paste the following line of code in your terminal:

`curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/peoplepower/botengine/master/installer.sh | sudo /bin/bash`

**Note:** You must have Python 3 or newer on your computer to install and run the framework.

The installer file will download the BotEngine framework and all the dependencies needed to run composer.

When you clone the composer repository, be sure to add its location to your PYTHONPATH variable.


## Documentation

Each Lesson contains a bot with documentation. Open the bot.py file for step-by-step instructions to learn how to create your own bot micro-services on top of Internet-connected products.
