# Bot Lab: Add Thoughts to Things.

The Bot Lab contains the BotEngine Python framework, enabling developers to create new features and services on top of every Internet-connected data source or device. This is no longer the Internet of Things. This is Ambient Computing.

## Installation

To install the BotEngine framework on your local machine, copy and paste the following line of code in your terminal:

`curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/peoplepower/botengine/master/installer.sh | sudo /bin/bash`

The installer file will download the BotEngine framework and all the dependencies needed to run botengine.

When you clone the botengine repository, be sure to add its location to your PYTHONPATH variable.

BotEngine prefers Python 2.7. Python 3.x or newer is available with certain configurations.


## Documentation

Each Lesson contains a bot with documentation. Open the bot.py file for step-by-step instructions to learn how to create your own bot micro-services on top of Internet-connected products.
