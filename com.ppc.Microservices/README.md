# Microservices Library

This directory is not a runnable bot. It contains a library of self-describing microservice packages inside the `intelligence/` folder. 

Any microservice package can be pulled into your bot service by adding them to the `microservices` field in your bot's `structure.json` file.

This allows you to create a package of microservices that can be shared amongst multiple bot services without forking code.
